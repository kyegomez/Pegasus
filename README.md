# multimodal-embeddings
Embedding Model that can generate embeddings for multi modality data types personalized for any task.

# Roadmap

* Reconfigure the imagebind model to use flash attention for context length increase

* Pretrain on the same datasets imagebind normal was trained on

* benchmark

* Finetune on long samples
