# Pegasus: Multimodal Embedding Library

Pegasus is a powerful library for generating high-quality embeddings from multimodal data. It provides an easy-to-use interface to create task-specific embeddings from various types of data, such as text, audio, and vision. With Pegasus, you can leverage the power of multimodal learning to unlock new possibilities in machine learning applications.

## Features

- Supports multiple modalities: Pegasus supports text, audio, and vision modalities, allowing you to generate embeddings from different types of data.
- Easy integration: Pegasus provides a simple and intuitive API for embedding data, making it easy to integrate into your existing workflows.
- High-quality embeddings: Pegasus utilizes state-of-the-art models to generate high-quality embeddings that capture the rich information present in multimodal data.
- Parallel processing: Pegasus supports parallel processing, allowing you to efficiently process large volumes of data by leveraging multiple CPU cores.
- Error handling and logging: Pegasus includes robust error handling and logging functionalities, providing clear and informative error messages for easier debugging.

## Installation

To install Pegasus, you can use pip:

```
pip install pegasus
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use Pegasus to generate embeddings from text data:

```python
from pegasus import Pegasus

# Create a Pegasus instance for text embeddings
pegasus = Pegasus(modality='text')

# Define some text data
text_data = [
    'This is an example sentence.',
    'Here is another sentence.',
    'And one more sentence about natural language processing'
]

# Embed the text data
embeddings = pegasus.embed_data(text_data)

# Print the embeddings
print(embeddings)
```

This will output the embeddings generated from the text data.

## Examples

### Text Embeddings

```python
from pegasus import Pegasus

# Create a Pegasus instance for text embeddings
pegasus = Pegasus(modality='text')

# Define some text data
text_data = [
    'This is an example sentence.',
    'Here is another sentence.',
    'And one more sentence about natural language processing'
]

# Embed the text data
embeddings = pegasus.embed_data(text_data)

# Print the embeddings
print(embeddings)
```

### Vision Embeddings

```python
from pegasus import Pegasus

# Create a Pegasus instance for vision embeddings
pegasus = Pegasus(modality='vision')

# Define the path to the image file
image_path = 'path/to/image.jpg'

# Embed the image
embeddings = pegasus.embed_data(image_path)

# Print the embeddings
print(embeddings)
```

### Audio Embeddings

```python
from pegasus import Pegasus

# Create a Pegasus instance for audio embeddings
pegasus = Pegasus(modality='audio')

# Define the path to the audio file
audio_path = 'path/to/audio.wav'

# Embed the audio
embeddings = pegasus.embed_data(audio_path)

# Print the embeddings
print(embeddings)
```
